        Flop.js is a scratch-style rendering library. It is made to create a link between scratch and js. It uses html
        canvas elements to implement projects. There are two main libraries in flop:
        <code>flop-vm</code> and
        <code>flop-render</code>.<br>
        <code>flop-vm</code> processes all the data, positions and provides user functions such as
        <code>moveSteps(10);</code> and
        <code>setCostume()</code>.<br>
        <code>flop-render</code> takes the data from
        <code>flop-vm</code>, and fittingly, renders it. It uses
        <code>scratch-render</code> as a dependecy, and passes the values from
        <code>flop-vm</code> into it. It also handles the
        <code>renderLoop</code> which is system which sets up a re-render every frame.<br>

        Flop.js is an asynchronous library, which means, you have to use&nbsp
        <code>await</code> and
        <code>async</code>
        with your code.
